// Scenario:
// You're building an application for an ice cream shop. They want a feature that 
// recommends an ice cream flavor based on the current temperature in Fahrenheit.

// 1. Create a variable named temperature any value between 32 and 68.


// 2. Create a variable named recommendedFlavor. Do not assign a value.


// 3. Implement the recommendation logic
//     If the temperature is less than 50, recommend "Hot Chocolate Fudge".
//     If the temperature is between 50 and 68 (inclusive), recommend "Caramel Crunch".
//     If the temperature is greater than 68, recommend "Lemon Sorbet".


// 4. Console log the recommended flavor.
